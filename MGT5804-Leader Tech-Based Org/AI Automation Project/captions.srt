Hi everyone, this is Gasser Ahmed.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:08,590
Welcome to this presentation where Iâ€™m going
to talk about the AI technology strategy for

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,530
the Lawn Buddy app.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:18,640
I am building an AI-powered strategy for a
lawn service startup company called Lawn Buddy

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,730
that allows lawn owners to input information
about their lawn to help determining the type

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:29,570
of service the lawn needs then customers will
be able to schedule and confirm their lawn

7
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,700
service appointment

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,469
Lawn Buddy however faces few strategic problems
for instance landscape maintenance involves

9
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:43,739
multiple tasks that must be performed properly
at the right time to avoid losing the advantage

10
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:45,650
of natural process.

11
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:50,820
In addition, scheduling and dispatching landscapers
on time with the right equipment makes a big

12
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,090
difference to operations and profitability.

13
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:59,199
Also, since the business is seasonal, keeping
the equipment safe and in a ready-to-operate

14
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,229
condition when the crew needs them at the
job site is a challenge and requires proper

15
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:07,580
usage and maintenance on a routine basis.

16
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:12,259
Lastly Green industry regulations whether
it is related to the use of pesticides and

17
00:01:12,259 --> 00:01:20,120
fertilizers, or the equipment and pollution
levels is a big challenge for Lawn Buddy.

18
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,760
For the previous problems Lawn Buddy should
use object recognition to scan and evaluate

19
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:30,020
the lawn to determine the right time to perform
lawn maintenance tasks.

20
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:35,630
Lawn Buddy should also use an equipment maintenance
program to track the equipment in use in real-time

21
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:41,680
and notify the crew member about the upcoming
maintenance lastly Lawn Buddy should have

22
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,590
the right inspection tools, historical records,
and a knowledge-base to help in keeping up

23
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,520
with the regulatory standards

24
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,750
Lawn Buddy is targeting early adopters as
they are happy to test the product, provide

25
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,719
feedback, and hope to simplify everyday tasks.

26
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,719
The targeted early adopters will be those
who do not have time to dedicate to lawn maintenance

27
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:11,500
or physically unable to provide care to their
lawn like the elderly, sick individuals or

28
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:17,120
disabled persons in addition to those who
do not have lawn care tools and seek lawn

29
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,200
services.

30
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:26,090
Lawn Buddy uses a principle of machine and
deep learning called object recognition where

31
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:31,700
computer vision technique allows users to
identify and locate objects in an image.

32
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:38,220
Lawn Buddy has a thorough dataset of all types
of lawns like lawn color or quality blade

33
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,760
length lawn size, and lawn terrain.

34
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:52,110
Having this dataset allows us to have the
most accurate reading of the image recognition.

35
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,590
By analyzing that dataset Lawn Buddy uses
the criteria of computer vision in order to

36
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:02,260
break down the classification, localization
and tagging.

37
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:07,900
Lawn buddy uses the classification feature
to detect the lawn, localization to determine

38
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:13,970
lawn size, and tagging to further find the
lawn quality which is measured through lawn

39
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:21,180
color and blade length which determines when
the lawn needs to be trimmed.

40
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:27,420
The value network of Lawn Buddy consists of
multiple key players like homeowners who use

41
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:33,950
the tool to provide information about lawn,
schedule appointments, and confirm payments.

42
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:39,220
Credit Payment Service, which enables secured
payment transactions between homeowners and

43
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,220
lawn professionals.

44
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:47,610
Lawn Professionals, who use tool to confirm
appointments and provide reports about services.

45
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:52,739
Home Improvement Stores, that enable new lawn
mowing services to lawn professionals.

46
00:03:52,739 --> 00:04:00,110
Homeowners Insurance, that reduces lawn care
costs by paying for lawn damage caused by

47
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:03,090
an earthquake or a flood.

48
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:10,200
Data Analytics, by selling data to third parties
for research and additional services.

49
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:18,009
AI Engineers who analyze data to provide algorithms
improvements and service solutions and lastly

50
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:24,790
those who use the app to promote and sell
other services to stakeholders.

51
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:28,530
So as a wrap up Lawn Buddy is a pioneering
idea.

52
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:34,100
By mobilizing lawn maintenance, the company
actively implements ease and efficiency.

53
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,170
At Lawn Buddy the lawn professional comes
to the customer knowing exactly what needs

54
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:43,880
to be done where the process is completely
contact-free Lawn Buddy also projects many

55
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,720
goals to further grow the company for year
1 the company plans to convert into a fully

56
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,320
functioning service then after 5 years, lawn
buddy plans to broaden service offerings and

57
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,160
after 10 years the plan is to broaden geographic
locations and move at a national level.

58
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,260
Thank you for watching!
