we are working on a customer discovery process to validate the need for a new AI power solution to help busy, disabled, or elderly people easily and efficiently mow their lawn. Please help me develop a set of survey questions that I can ask a group of those customers to figure out what their critical needs and wants are. The survey should take a customer about 5-20 minutes to complete. Please use a combination of short answer questions along with survey questions with likert-type scales with a range of 1-5 with 5 being the 'best' and 1 being the 'worst'
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Certainly! Here's a combination of short answer questions and Likert-scale survey questions that you can use to gather insights about the critical needs and wants of your target customers:

1. How would you describe your current experience with lawn mowing and maintenance?
2. What are the biggest challenges or difficulties you face when it comes to mowing your lawn efficiently?
3. In your opinion, what are the most important features or functionalities that an AI-powered lawn mowing solution should have?
4. How would an AI-powered lawn mowing solution specifically benefit you, considering your busy schedule, disability, or age?
5. Do you have any concerns or reservations about incorporating AI technology into your lawn mowing routine?
6. Are there any specific safety considerations that are particularly important to you when using a lawn mowing solution?

Likert-Scale Survey Questions:

Please rate the following statements on a scale of 1-5, with 5 being the best and 1 being the worst:
